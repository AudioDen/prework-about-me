      <h1>BIO</h1>
    <p>Jamal was born Frederick Russell Jones in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 2, 1930. 
        He began playing piano at the age of three, when his uncle Lawrence challenged him to duplicate what he was doing on the piano.
         Jamal began formal piano training at the age of seven with Mary Cardwell Dawson, whom he describes as greatly influencing him.
          His Pittsburgh roots have remained an important part of his identity ("Pittsburgh meant everything to me and it still does," he said in 2001) 
          and it was there that he was immersed in the influence of jazz artists such as Earl Hines, Billy Strayhorn, Mary Lou Williams, and Erroll Garner. 
          Jamal also studied with pianist James Miller and began playing piano professionally at the age of fourteen, at which point he was recognized as a "coming great" by the pianist Art Tatum.
           When asked about his practice habits by a critic from The New York Times, Jamal commented that, "I used to practice and practice with the door open, hoping someone would come by and discover me. 
           I was never the practitioner in the sense of twelve hours a day, but I always thought about music. I think about music all the time."</p>
